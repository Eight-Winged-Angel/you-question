# you-question
An web application for online question bank

The basic requirements for this project are as follows:

(1) User registration and login.
(2) Teachers can create, modify, and delete courses; students can join courses; both teachers and students can view course information. When a course is created, the backend assigns it an invitation code, which students use to join the course.
(3) Teachers can post and delete course notifications, and both teachers and students can view these notifications.
(4) Teachers can view a list of students who have enrolled in their courses.
(5) Teachers can create and view questions, with support for five types of questions: multiple-choice, multiple-response, true/false, fill-in-the-blank, and essay.
(6) Teachers can create and view exercises, choosing questions from either their own question bank or the site-wide question bank to compose the exercises.
(7) Teachers can release exercises for a course, selecting from existing exercises or using others' exercises through an invitation code.
(8) Teachers can view the exercise status for a particular course.
(9) Students can complete exercises, with the system automatically correcting the questions.
(10) Users can view and edit their personal information in the user center, and can log out.
